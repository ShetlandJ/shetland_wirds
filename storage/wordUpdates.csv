a,1,indefinite article,indf,"OE ān 'one, a, lone, sole' < PGmc. (num) *ainaz 'one (sg), some (pl)' <PIE *óynos 'one, single'"
a,2,"on (unstressed positions). Also the default in appellation names, ie names that describe a place of origin, eg Leslie a Gairderhoose",prep,"OE an (stress), on (unstressed). Before 1200 unstressed an/on was reduced to a/o (whence eg ashore), unless the following word began with a vowel or h-. Cf. ON á < PN an < PGmc. *ana 'on, onto' < PIE *h₂en- 'up, on high'. Appelation names, ie personal names that include a geographical designation, were formed with á 'on' in Old Norse (along with í 'in'), and are still formed with the descendant på 'on' in the Scandinavian languages, along with the preposition av (< af 'of'), and sometimes i 'in'. Thus Anne of Greengables is Anne på Grönkulla. The use of 'on' rather than 'of' in Shaetlan appellation names may therefore be a remnant of Norn naming practices."
