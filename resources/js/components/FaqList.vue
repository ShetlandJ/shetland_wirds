            Why are there English words in the dictionary?
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-white mb-4">
            The words in this dictionary are those that can be found in the
            Shaetlan dictionaries listed on our
            <a class="underline" href="/about">About page</a> and in the speech
            of the 20 Shetlanders in the Shetland Museum and Archive oral
            history interviews. Some words and their spellings will overlap with
            English, such as when George Gear, Mary Manson, James Ritch, Harriet
            Sandison, etc speaks about da sea, a ship, a parish, a piano, a
            pier, an ambulance, etc. But they are words found in Shaetlan speech
            that have been localised to a relevant Shaetlan context, and are
            therefore relevant for the Shaetlan language.

        <p class="dark:text-white mb-4 text-lg font-bold">
            Why don’t you spell English words the English way?
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-white mb-2">
            Words like plaess, airm, neest are old Scots words and are no more
            exclusively English than they are Scots. They entered the lexicon in
            Old English times, and the descendants of Northumbrian Old English,
            such as Scots, ended up having and reflecting one pronunciation,
            while the descendent of Mercian Old English (i.e. English), ended up
            having another, more influenced by Norman French (for more on the
            history of Shaetlan, see
            <a
                class="underline"

shaetlan"
                >here</a
            >).
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-white mb-4">
            Ultimately plaess, for example, goes back to Latin platea, which is
            also the origin of Swedish plats ‘place’ and Norwegian plass​
            ‘place’. No localised spelling is more correct than the other, but
            in the Shetland context the English spelling is the familiar one
            because English has been the medium of instruction in schools for
            the last 200 years. However, the English spelling does not reflect
            the Shaetlan pronunciation, nor the history of the word, which came
            here with Scots long before English did. In other words, these kinds
            of words do not “belong” to English any more than they “belong” to
            Swedish, Norwegian or Scots. They are simply localised spellings
            that are locally relevant. Once Shaetlan is used as a medium of
            instruction in schools, the locally relevant spellings will feel as
            familiar as any other. For more on the principles behind our
            spelling system, see

            Shaetlan has so much variation, how can that be represented in one
            spelling system?
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-white mb-4">
            An archipelago like Shetland is expected to have linguistic
            variation. It would be highly exceptional if it did not (but it is
            not the most linguistically diverse area of the world, as is
            sometimes assumed. That is Vanuatu, with 138 mutually unintelligible
            languages, all with their own internal regional and social
            variation). The crucial thing about a spelling system is that it is
            not an exact phonetic transcription of speech, but a pragmatic way
            of showing commonalities across a speech community. In other words,
            a spelling system is always a compromise and never reflects the
            exact speech of any one individual. This means that a reader does
            not have to know the voice of a writer in order to be able to read
            the text: the convention allows the text to be understood widely
            across the community. This is the case with English, which has 77
            varieties listed in the electronic
            <a

            has more than 1,600 voices from 135 countries in it. Yet all those
            voices get the same spelling for such words as water, light, rain,
            through, face, etc. For a more in depth discussion on a spelling

            This is a Scots word, you can find it all over the Scots area, why

            As mentioned above at the top of this page, this is not a dictionary

                There are two potential reasons why you can’t find a particular

            <p class="dark:text-white mb-2">
                (1) it spelled differently from your first search attempt. A way
                to check that is to search for the translation into English.

            <p class="dark:text-white mb-2">
                (2) it is not in the dictionary at all.

                In that case we strongly encourage you to contribute it! This is
